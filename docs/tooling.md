## Libraries

A few libraries that the authors of this template have vetted and think you might find useful:

| [`bevy_common_assets`](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_common_assets)                 | Asset loading  | Asset loaders for common file formats |

| [`iyes_progress`](https://github.com/IyesGames/iyes_progress)                          | Asset loading  | Progress tracking                     |
| [`bevy_kira_audio`](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_kira_audio)                       | Audio          | Advanced audio                        |
| [`bevy_cobweb_ui`](https://github.com/UkoeHB/bevy_cobweb_ui)                                | UI             | UI framework providing reactivity, widgets, and localization                            |

In particular:.

- `leafwing-input-manager` and `bevy_mod_picking` are very likely to be upstreamed into Bevy in the near future.
- `bevy-inspector-egui` and `bevy_mod_debugdump` help fill the gap until Bevy has its own editor.
- `avian` or `bevy_rapier` helps fill the gap until Bevy has its own physics engine. `avian` is easier to use, while `bevy_rapier` is more performant.
- `bevy_cobweb_ui` is well-aligned with `bevy_ui` and helps fill the gap until Bevy has a full collection of UI widgets and functionality.

None of these are necessary, but they can save you a lot of time and effort.

## VS Code extensions

If you're using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the following extensions are highly recommended:

| Name                                                                                                      | Description                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)              | Rust support                      |
| [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml)          | TOML support                      |
| [vscode-ron](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=a5huynh.vscode-ron)                      | RON support                       |
| [Dependi](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fill-labs.dependi)                          | `crates.io` dependency resolution |
| [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) | `.editorconfig` support           |

> [!Note]
> <details>
> <summary>About the included rust-analyzer settings</summary>
>
> This template sets [`rust-analyzer.cargo.targetDir`](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/generated_config.html#rust-analyzer.cargo.targetDir)
> to `true` in [`.vscode/settings.json`](../.vscode/settings.json).
>
> This makes `rust-analyzer` use a different `target` directory than `cargo`,
> which means that you can run commands like `cargo run` even while `rust-analyzer` is still indexing.
> As a trade-off, this will use more disk space.
>
> If that is an issue for you, you can set it to `false` or remove the setting entirely.
